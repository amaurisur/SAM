======================================================== BASEX TESTS ===

 This package contains various tests that are used in BaseX development.
 These tests did not make it into the main repository because they are:

 * broken
 * stress tests that are intended to be run for a long time
 * in the making

 The former list is not exhaustive, so feel free to update this Readme.
 Tests are run with the help of maven:

 `mvn test`

 For questions or feedback, feel free to use the Tracker or our
 [Mailinglist](http://basex.org/open-source/ "BaseX | Open Source").
